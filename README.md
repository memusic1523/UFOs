# UFOs
System: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, HTML, CSS

# Overview
We helped filter data to generate information about UFO sightings. By helping Dana with her webpage and the data that was provided we were able to do an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

# Results
  - Create a filter search button with multiple filter settings
  - Create a webpage with a dynamic table of data.
  - Create a new function to loop through the dataset to match results with search criteria
  - Generate an event listener to detect changes to each filter
  - Generate a function that saves the element, value, and the if of the filter that was changed
  
# Summary
In conclusion, we were able to create a webpage that has data about UFO sightings. Users can search for multiple filter criteria that interest them. They can look up through the city, state, shape, and country. With this great webpage, I believe having a more in-depth finding or reference of the UFO sighting data be linked to other websites. The data that was given is very limited so having more data would be useful.
