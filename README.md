System: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, HTML, CSS

# Overview
We helped filter data to generate information about UFO sightings. By helping Dana with her webpage and the data that was provided we were able to do an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

# Results
  - Create a filter search button with multiple filter settings
  - Create a webpage with a dynamic table of data.
  - Create a new function to loop through the dataset to match results with search criteria
  - Generate an event listener to detect changes to each filter
  - Generate a function that saves the element, value, and the if of the filter that was changed
  
# Summary
In conclusion, we were able to create a webpage that has data about UFO sightings. Users can search for multiple filter criteria that interest them. All the users have to do is complete search one of the filters. For example, if you are looking for UFO sighting in Arizona then all you have to do is go to the "Enter State" filter put "az" and it will show you all the information that was found in that state. They can look up through the city, state, shape, and country. With this great webpage, I believe having a more in-depth finding or reference of the UFO sighting data be linked to other websites. The drawback of this webpage is that the data that was given is very limited.  Another drawback is that there are no visualization of the sightings either image or drawing.
